	<h1>E-commerce: The Evolution of Online Shopping</h1>

	<!-- Paragraphs about the Evolution of E-commerce -->
	<h2>Evolution of E-commerce</h2>
	<p>Electronic commerce (more commonly known as e-commerce) refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. It has revolutionized the way businesses operate and consumers shop by providing a digital platform for transactions. In e-commerce, transactions are conducted online through websites, mobile apps, or other digital means, eliminating the need for physical storefronts and human interaction. The history of e-commerce dates to the 1960s with the development of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems, which allowed businesses to exchange documents and conduct transactions electronically. However, the true expansion of e-commerce began in the 1990s with the emergence of the World Wide Web and the first online retail stores. Since then, e-commerce has grown exponentially, driven by the increased availability of technology, changes in consumer behavior, and the globalization of markets. Links to three popular e-commerce sites are provided at the bottom of the page.</p>
	<p>While e-commerce offers unparalleled convenience and accessibility for consumers, it also comes with certain drawbacks and risks. One of the primary disadvantages is the lack of tactile experience and personal interaction inherent in online shopping, which can hinder consumers' ability to evaluate product quality before making a purchase. Additionally, concerns about cybersecurity and data privacy may deter some consumers from engaging in online transactions, especially considering the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches. You can read about cybersecurity risks and preventative measures to take on page 3. In conclusion, e-commerce has profoundly transformed the global economy, revolutionizing the way businesses operate, and how consumers shop. From its humble beginnings in the early days of the internet to its status as an indispensable part of modern life, it is undeniable the impact the online medium has had on commerce.</p>
