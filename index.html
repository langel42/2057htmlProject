    <h1>Welcome to the Internet</h1>
    <p>The Internet has undeniably shaped human life in the modern age, from everyday life to human society on a global scale. Since the advent of the Internet to its rapid rise to prominence in the current day, this technological infrastructure has been developed and adapted in several notable milestones. This page will briefly cover the storied history of the internet, beginning with its first concepts and ending with the all-encompassing online platform we are familiar with today. To start, the intention of the internet's invention has always been to facilitate efficient communication and information sharing between people. This can be seen in the early inception of the internet, which started in 1969, with the invention of Arpanet. Arpanet was the first network to run on packet-switching and allowed two separate computers to connect and exchange messages for the first time in history (Craig). Additionally, 1969 was also the year development for Unix began, and this operating system would influence operating systems of popular modern day web servers (Craig).</p>
    <p>In the 70's, the preliminary stages of the internet would continue to be developed. 1971 saw the creation of Email by Ray Tomlinson as well as Project Gutenberg by Michael Hart (Craig). A significant development was that of TCP/IP in 1974, which aimed to connect Arpa-like networks into an "inter-network" (Craig). The first PC modem was developed by Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington in 1977 and was a crucial development towards the internet as we know it today (Craig). 1979 saw the development of the first ever multiplayer game, as well as Usenet (Craig). The 80’s saw the growth of internet use, with several notable events including the creation of the domain name system (DNS), the first major malicious internet-based attack in 1988, and the proposal for the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 (Craig). The 90’s would bring about the development of the World Wide Web, setting in place the standard protocols HTML, HTTP, and URLS (Craig).</p>
    <p>Throughout the 1990’s, the internet was slowly shaping into the online landscape we are more familiar with today. From the first search engine created in 1991, to the first appearance of social media in 1996, internet development was moving at a rapid pace (Craig). 1997 was the year of the invention of Wi-Fi, marking a turning point in online and internet development (Craig). In 1998, Google was launched, revolutionizing information searching online (Craig). 2000 to 2010 saw the launch of Wikipedia; the popularization of VoIP with the release of Skype; the invention of Web 2.0; and the launch of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to name a few (Craig). The 2010’s onward see an exponential growth in internet usage amongst casual users and the public, with the creation and updates to numerous social media platforms and streaming services all vying to reach the top, to the first emergence of AI technology irreversibly changing the landscape of the internet yet again (Craig). In the end, the development and use of the internet has becoming intrinsically linked with life in human society today, and as technology advances further with the introduction of artificial intelligence, the internet will never stagnate in its evolution.</p>
