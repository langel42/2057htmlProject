	<!-- Paragraphs about Common Online Threats and Security Measures -->
	<h2>Common Online Threats and Security Measures</h2>
	<p>Web-based threats, also known as online threats, are security risks that may result in negative affects and actions against the user (Kapersky). Similar to a home-invasion in real life, leaving one’s proverbial “front door” unlocked whilst online can result in sensitive private information being stolen. Additionally, seeing as the internet has become so ingrained into our everyday life, it isn’t hard to see the potential damage of having your passwords and data leaked. This page will aim to cover the different types of web threats, as well as suggest ways to mitigate these risks. To begin, web threats can be made by user vulnerabilities, web service operations, or web services entirely (Kapersky). Web threats typically fall into three categories: Private network threats, host threats, and web server threats. We will take a deeper look into how internet-based threats affect people and computer systems in the next paragraph.</p>
	<p>Threats to people and computer systems can occur either online or offline, such as computer viruses and phishing. Web threats are differentiated as they involve the internet at some point in the attack (Kapersky). Vulnerabilities for web threats can come from the user or the web service, intentionally or unintentionally. Possible outcomes are typically access denial to a computer or network services; access acquisition which includes unauthorized entry to a private computer or network services; and data breaches to photos, account information, and even government information (Kapersky). A few components to web threats are: threat motives which may or may not be absent; threat agents as the perpetrators behind any possible negative impact; vulnerabilities in human behavior or technology that may result in damage; and threat outcomes which are the result of the web threat (Kapersky). Threat agents can be classified into the following different types: non-human agents, intentional human agents, accidental human agents, and negligence -based human agents (Kapersky). The next paragraph will discuss ways to mitigate and minimize cybersecurity risks while online.</p>
	<p>The first and most important step to maintaining cyber security is to ensure your software and hardware is up-to-date, frequently check the settings app on your operating system to keep your system updated. Avoid opening or responding to suspicious emails and double-check to ensure any tech support or customer service website you are on is trusted and legitimate. Of course, it goes without saying not to share your account credentials or sensitive information over the internet. Use trusted anti-virus and anti-malware software; the recent versions of Windows comes with Windows Security by default. Consider getting a VPN to make your connections more private, this is especially useful when connecting to a public network. Speaking of which, generally avoid using public networks, or retrieving sensitive information on public networks without a VPN. Double check website links before clicking on them, and check that they are using HTTPS for secure transfer of information. 2-Factor Authentication is a newer technology that enables you to keep your accounts more secure by verifying that it is actually you before allowing you access to your account. There are plenty more precautions you can take as an individual to minimize your risks to web threats, and there will be external pages linked for optional reading.</p>
